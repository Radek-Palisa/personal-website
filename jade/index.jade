		//- 		p A static website with the purpose of stating business intent as well as a personal presentation of the client. To reflect this, I opted for one-page design with a number of sub-pages for 'learn-more' content. Coded semantically in HTML5, modularly in CSS3, with custom Jquery and one external JS plugin for image sliding. It is fully responsive with the design accommodating different screen sizes accordingly.

					p <span>January 2015</span>I came out of university with a degree, which allowed me to have elaborated discourses with anyone willing to listen at a local pub, but which proved rather difficult to get me a job. Starting work in Data Management in SAP was a first step to a remedy. Having learned the ins and outs of the job, however, the tasks became very monotonous and repetitive. After a brief mid-life crisis in my mid-twenties, I discovered coding.

				#sec2.accordion-content(labelledby="ctrl2", role="region", aria-hidden="true")
					p <span>March 2016</span>After a year of intensive, daily code learning in my spare time, I decided to leave SAP. I wanted  to be coding full-time and knew that I needed experience. Fortunately, my father was imprudent enough to entrust me with building a web presence for his small business, Auto Caravan Sport. Finally, I found myself applying previously learned design and UX principles on a real project. I was writing for-production code and dealing with various browser quirks. Internet Explorer started haunting me in my dreams.

				#sec3.accordion-content(labelledby="ctrl3", role="region", aria-hidden="true")
					p <span>September 2016</span>Alensa was a turning point for me. After slightly more than one year, I progressed from did-you-try-to-turn-it-off-and-on type of knowledge to a full time job as a Front-End Developer. At Alensa, I started connecting the dots about server-client communication, fetching and ajaxing, and got introduced to PHP. I took part in the shaping the UI/UX of a successful e-commerce company. Above all, I was increasingly diving into Javascript both at and off work.
